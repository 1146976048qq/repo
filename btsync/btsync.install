	* Running btsync system instance (using dedicated btsync:btsync account)

  	  System instance of btsync is preconfigured (configuration file located
	  at /etc/btsync.conf) and can be used directly after installation.

	  Execute:

	    to reload system systemd modules:     systemctl daemon-reload
	    to start btsync manually:             systemctl start btsync
	    to autostart btsync on system start:  systemctl enable btsync

	* Running btsync user instance (using current user account)

	  User instance MUST be configured before use. To perform configuration, 
	  install btsync-autoconfig package or follow manual configuration steps:

  	    1. Copy /etc/btsync/btsync.conf to ~/.config/btsync/btsync.conf for
 	    the user you wish to configure btsync:
 	
	      mkdir -p ~/.config/btsync	
	      cp /etc/btsync.conf ~/.config/btsync/btsync.conf
 
	    2. Replace user-specific references with the appropriate information,
	    including the following settings:
 
	      - storage_path
	      - pid_file
	      - webui.listen
	      - webui.login
	      - webui.password

	    3. Make sure folder you specified as storage_path and folder where pid_file will
	    be located both exist in the filesystem, since btsync will not create it for you.

	  Execute:

	    to reload user systemd modules:       systemctl --user daemon-reload
	    to start btsync manually:             systemctl --user start btsync
	    to autostart btsync on user login:    systemctl --user enable btsync
