If you are reporting out-of-date packages, make sure one of the following is true (or you can just wait for up to one day):

* [ ] the new release is released for more than one day
* [ ] there is no file named `lilac.py` alongside the PKGBUILD for the package here

----

如果你要报告过期的软件包，请确认以下条件中至少有一项成立（否则你只需要等待最多一天就好）：

* [ ] 新版本已经发布超过一天
* [ ] 在该软件包的 PKGBUILD 同级目录里没有叫 `lilac.py` 的文件
